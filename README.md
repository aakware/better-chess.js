## ‚ú® Features

`better-chess.js` extends the popular `chess.js` library, providing a richer API for deeper analytical insights directly within your chess applications. It's built with TypeScript for robust type-safety and enhanced developer experience.

- **‚ö° Real-time Move Analysis:** Get detailed tactical and positional insights immediately after making a move.
- **üîç On-Demand Square Analysis:** Query any square on the board for comprehensive analysis of pieces, attacks, defenses, and inherent tactics.
* **üß† Tactical Pattern Detection:** Automatically identifies common chess tactics like:
    * **Forks** (Knights, Queens, Rooks, Bishops)
    * **Pins** 
    * **Skewers**
    * And more coming soon!
- **üìä Material Tracking:** Automatically tracks available material for both sides.
- **üíØ Type-Safe & Modern:** Written entirely in TypeScript, offering excellent IntelliSense and reducing common runtime errors.
- **üß© Extends `chess.js`:** All familiar `chess.js` methods and functionalities are fully inherited and available.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install better-chess.js
```


## üìñ Usage

You can use `better-chess.js` just like you would with `chess.js`, but with the added benefit of advanced analysis capabilities. You will get 2 new methods: `moveAndAnalyze` and `analyzeAt`, and a property `material` to track the material available for both sides.

```ts
import { BetterChess } from 'better-chess.js';

const chess = new BetterChess();

/* ‚ö° Grab the move analysis after making a move */
const analysis = chess.moveAndAnalyze({
    from: 'e2',
    to: 'e4',
    promotion: 'q' // Optional, for pawn promotion
});


/* üîç Analyze a specific square */
const squareAnalysis = chess.analyzeAt('g6');
```

## üéØ Analysis Format 

The analysis object follows this format:

```ts
/* üí° The Analysis Object Type! */
export type MoveEffect = {
    piece: PieceInEffect;
    capturedPiece?: PieceInEffect;

    type: MoveEffectType;
    defense: 'underdefended' | 'undefended' | 'defended' | 'overdefended';

    attacks: PieceInEffect[];
    defends: PieceInEffect[];

    tactics: TacticalMove[];
    hangingPieces: {
        w: PieceInEffect[];
        b: PieceInEffect[];
    };
};
```


The other types used in the analysis are defined as follows:

```ts
/* ‚ôüÔ∏è General Piece Information */
export type PieceInEffect = {
    at: string;
    name: string;
    color: 'w' | 'b';
    attackers: PieceInEffect[];
    defenders: PieceInEffect[];
}

/* üß† Tactical Move Information */
export type TacticalMove = {
    tactic: 'fork' | 'pin' | 'skewer' | 'doubleCheck' | 'trap';
    targets: PieceInEffect[];
}

/* üß© Move Effect Types */
type MoveEffectType = 
    | 'promotion'
    | 'capture'
    | 'check'
    | 'checkmate'
    | 'stalemate'
    | 'enPassant'
    | 'castling'
    | 'normal'
    | 'attacking'
    | 'fianchetto';
```

Let's consider the following position as mentioned in the image below, the latest move was Bishop to g4, pinning the Knight on f3 against the Queen on d1.

![Sample Analysis Output](/assets/sample-position.png)

The corresponding analysis output for this position would look like this:

```json
{
    "piece": {
        "at": "g4",
        "name": "b",
        "color": "b",
        "attackers": [],

        // which pieces are defending the bishop on g4?
        "defenders": [
            {
                "at": "f6",
                "name": "n",

                "defenders": []
            }
        ]
    },

    // any tactical patterns detected in this position?
    "tactics": [
        {
            "tactic": "pin",

            // [0] -> the piece being pinned
            // [1] -> the piece behind the pinned piece

                {

                "at": "e4",

                    {
                        "at": "f6",
                        "name": "n",
                        "color": "b",
                        "attackers": [],
                        "defenders": []
                    },
                    {
                        "at": "d5",
                        "name": "p",
                        "color": "b",
                        "attackers": [],
                        "defenders": []
                    }
                ],
                "defenders": []
            }
        ],
        "b": [] // No hanging pieces for black in this position
    }
}
```

## Material Tracking 
`better-chess.js` automatically tracks the material available for both sides. You can access this information using:

```ts
const { w, b } = chess.material;

console.log(w) // { p: 8, n: 2, b: 2, r: 2, q: 1 }
console.log(b) // { p: 8, n: 2, b: 2, r: 2, q: 1 }
```

And yes, it also updates automatically as moves are made, captures occur, and promotions happen.

Although `chess.js` provides a robust foundation for chess game logic, `better-chess.js` extends its capabilities by offering direct, integrated analysis for tactical patterns and positional characteristics. 

This saves developers' time from having to implement complex analysis algorithms themselves, allowing them to focus on building engaging chess applications with advanced features.

---

## üìú TODO
- [ ] Add support for more tactical patterns (e.g., discovered attacks, double attacks).
- [ ] Maybe add engine integration support for engine reviews and evaluations.
- [ ] Anything else you suggest!
